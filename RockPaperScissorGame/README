Firstly, It creates a Scanner object named userInput to read user input.

The code enters a while loop that continues indefinitely (while(true)) until the user enters "quit".

Inside the loop, the user is prompted to input their move using userInput.nextLine().

If the user enters "quit", the loop breaks, and the game ends.

If the user enters a move that is not "rock", "paper", or "scissors", an error message is displayed.

If the user's input is valid (rock, paper, or scissors), a random number is generated to determine the computer opponent's move.

The opponent's move is determined based on the random number.

The user's move and opponent's move are compared to decide the winner or if it's a tie.

The result of the game is printed to the console.
